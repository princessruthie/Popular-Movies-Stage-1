# Popular-Movies-Stage-1 #

===================================

Udacity Project 1: Current progress uses httpurlconnection and a homemade POJO.  The detail view currently does not have the movie duration.  I can't tell right now if we're supposed to/allowed to use GSON.  

This app displays a list of Popular or High-Rated movies.  Clicking on any movie leads to a detail view that shows additional information about the movie.

While not perfect, this project is no longer actively maintained.  For that, please see [Popular-Movies-Stage-2](https://github.com/princessruthie/Popular-Movies-Stage-2)
